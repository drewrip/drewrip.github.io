I am an undergraduate student at Ohio State studying computer science and engineering. My research interests are broadly in the area of distributed systems. I am advised by [Yang Wang](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.7564/). This past summer I was an undergraduate research intern at Microsoft Research, where I was mentored by [Srinath Setty](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/srinath/).
